## Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Pattern

> RAG is an approach that enables you to harness the power of LLMs with your own data. Enabling an LLM to access custom data involves the following steps. First, the large data should be chunked into manageable pieces. Second, the chunks need to be converted into a searchable format. Third, the converted data should be stored in a location that allows efficient access. Additionally, it's important to store relevant metadata for citations or references when the LLM provides responses.

## Prompt flow

> The process of crafting effective and efficient prompts is called prompt design or prompt engineering. [prompt flow](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/ai-machine-learning-blog/harness-the-power-of-large-language-models-with-azure-machine/ba-p/3828459) is the interactive editor of Azure Machine Learning for prompt engineering projects.
